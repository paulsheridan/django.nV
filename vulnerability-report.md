##Vulnerability 1: Injection
###Exposure
We found an instance of vulnerability to injection by typing the following into the "new image" field: testPic',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),8);--.  Clicking the picture after that point provided a hashed version of the admin credentials.
###Repair
We no longer inject sql directly into the database, but instead we use the ORMs built in features to sanitize the inputs prior to entry.
##Vulnerability 2: Broken Auth
###Exposure
We were able to set the is_admin field by manually editing the new user form and swapping the 'email' spot for is_admin.  We were also able to do the same thing for is_superuser.
###Repair
To fix the problem we changed the 'exclude' field to an 'include' specifying only the fields that we want the user to have access to, such as first name, last name, email and password
